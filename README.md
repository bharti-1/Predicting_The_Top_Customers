# Term Deposit Subscription Prediction Dataset

**Dataset Source:** [Link to the source, if available]

**Description:**
This dataset contains information about customers and their interactions with a bank. It includes features like customer age, job type, marital status, education level, account balance, loan status, communication type, and more.

**Dataset Size:**
- Number of Records: 23,880
- Number of Features: 17

**Missing Data:**
Missing data in this dataset was handled through imputation. [Explain your imputation strategy, if relevant.]

**Target Variable:**
The target variable in this dataset is "term_deposit_subscribed," which indicates whether a customer subscribed to a term deposit (binary classification).

**Data Exploration:**
During exploratory data analysis (EDA), several insights were discovered, such as the influence of job type, marital status, education level, and communication type on subscription rates.

**Data Preprocessing:**
Categorical variables were one-hot encoded, and numerical features were standardized. Outliers were also addressed.

**Modeling:**
Three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree—were employed for predicting term deposit subscriptions. Class imbalance was handled using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).

**Model Evaluation:**
The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. [Include key performance metrics.]

**Future Steps:**
Potential improvements include hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and deeper analysis of misclassified instances.

**Data Citation:**
If you use this dataset, please cite the original source [if applicable] to give proper credit to the data provider.
